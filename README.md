# ObjectiveC_Extension

[![Carthage compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

Once I started developing my skills in Objective-C, I've noticed that while many things were pretty easy to do, others could be heavily simplified. I started with a `NSUtilities` class, which later became lots of extensions splitted in `+Extension` files. At some point, I had a separated folder for extensions and classes which I would import to almost every Objective-C project that I was involved.

In order to improve that, I've decided to create a framework with those classes and extensions, in order to optimize my work. It should be useful for a large range of projects, so feel free to use it, and enjoy :)

## Compatibility
This is the best part of that framework. ObjectiveC_Extension is compatible with every version of macOS still compatible with Xcode 9, so it is compatible with macOS 10.6+. Obviously, that requires some workarounds and *hacks*. They will be listed in the end of that document.

## New Classes (related with keycodes and devices)
Those classes were made to simplify the use of HID devices input, making your code cleaner when working with them, and more Objective-C-like, since most of the code related with that is C-like and C++-like. It also gives you enums to find the value of virtual keycodes (useful to simulate keyboard key pressing) and usage keycodes (useful to detect which keyboard key was pressed).

### VMMVirtualKeycodes
A class which makes working with Mac Virtual Keycodes easier.

```objectivec
+(NSArray*)allKeyNames;
```

List of all the Mac Virtual Keycodes names.

```objectivec
+(NSDictionary*)virtualKeycodeNames;
```

Dictionary of the Mac Virtual Keycodes names by keycode.

```objectivec
+(NSString*)nameOfVirtualKeycode:(CGKeyCode)key;
```

Name of Mac Virtual Keycode by keycode.

### VMMDeviceSimulator
A class which simulate keyboard and cursor actions.

```objectivec
+(void)simulateCursorClickAtScreenPoint:(CGPoint)clickPoint
```

Simulates the mouse left-click on a specific screen point moving the cursor.

```objectivec
+(void)simulateVirtualKeycode:(CGKeyCode)keyCode withKeyDown:(BOOL)keyPressed;
```

Simulates the button press/release of a Mac Virtual Keycode.

### VMMDeviceObserver
A class which makes working with HID devices easier.

```objectivec
+(instancetype)sharedObserver;
```

HID device observer shared instance.

```objectivec
-(void)observeDevicesOfTypes:(NSArray*)types forDelegate:(id<VMMDeviceObserverDelegate>)actionDelegate;
```

Adds object that should receive notifications of observer.

```objectivec
-(void)stopObservingForDelegate:(id<VMMDeviceObserverDelegate>)actionDelegate;
```

Makes an object stop receiving the observer notifications.

#### VMMDeviceObserverDelegate (Protocol)
Protocol for `VMMDeviceObserver` delegate. All the methods below are optionals. The only thing mandatory is the `hidManager` property.

```objectivec
@property (nonatomic) IOHIDManagerRef hidManager;
```

Manager that makes any object capable of observing HID devices.

```objectivec
-(void)observedConnectionOfDevice:(IOHIDDeviceRef)device;
```

```

Notify an object that a HID device has been disconnected.

```objectivec
-(void)observedEventWithName:(CFStringRef)name cookie:(IOHIDElementCookie)cookie usage:(uint32_t)usage value:(CFIndex)value device:(IOHIDDeviceRef)device;
```

Notify an object that a HID device has performed an event.

### VMMUsageKeycode

```objectivec
+(NSArray*)allUsageNames;
```

Name of keyboard keys that have a usage keycode.

```objectivec
+(NSDictionary*)usageNamesByKeycode;
```

Name of keyboard keys by usage keycode.

```objectivec
+(NSString*)nameOfUsageKeycode:(uint32_t)key;
```

## Workarounds and Hacks
Colors indecate the level of the hack: Green (![#00ff00](https://placehold.it/15/00ff00/000000?text=+)) means it can't be noticed; Blue (![#0000ff](https://placehold.it/15/0000ff/000000?text=+)) means it can only be noticed under certain circunstances, but it does not affect the UX; Yellow (![#ffff00](https://placehold.it/15/ffff00/000000?text=+)) means it can be noticed, and affect the UX, but just a little bit; Red (![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+)) means it can be noticed AND may affect the UX harshly.

### - ![#00ff00](https://placehold.it/15/00ff00/000000?text=+) [NSData jsonStringWithJsonObject:object] (macOS = 10.6)
The JSON string is created manually since `NSJSONSerialization` was not available before macOS 10.7.

### - ![#00ff00](https://placehold.it/15/00ff00/000000?text=+) [NSData dataWithJsonObject:object] (macOS = 10.6)
The JSON data is created based in the function above, since `NSJSONSerialization` was not available before macOS 10.7.

### - ![#00ff00](https://placehold.it/15/00ff00/000000?text=+) [(NSData*)object jsonObject] (macOS = 10.6)
The JSON object is created using `SZJsonParser` since `NSJSONSerialization` was not available before macOS 10.7. Some changes were in `SZJsonParser` to support the existence of base64 strings inside the JSON.

### - ![#0000ff](https://placehold.it/15/0000ff/000000?text=+) [(NSImage*)img saveAsIcnsAtPath:path] (macOS = 10.6)
In macOS 10.7+ systems, icns files are created with `iconutil`, using `tiff2icns` only if the first one does not return a valid image. macOS 10.6 systems create using `tiff2icns` only, since `iconutil` was introduced in macOS 10.7. The only consequence of that is that the icons created in macOS 10.6 are going to have only one size, which makes them look a bit bugged if you move them to a macOS 10.12+ computer and show them in Finder with the list view mode.

### - ![#ffff00](https://placehold.it/15/ffff00/000000?text=+) [(NSOpenPanel*)panel setWindowTitle:title] (macOS >= 10.11 )
From macOS 10.11 and on, the `setTitle:` function does nothing to `NSOpenPanel`'s. Considering that, this function uses `setMessage:` for macOS 10.11+ and `setTitle:` for macOS 10.10-.

### - ![#00ff00](https://placehold.it/15/00ff00/000000?text=+) ![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) [(VMMUserNotificationCenter*)notificationCenter deliverNotificationWithTitle:title message:message userInfo:info icon:icon actionButtonText:actionButton] (macOS <= 10.7)
Since `NSUserNotification` was only introduced in macOS 10.8, macOS 10.7 and below require a different approach. In those systems, `VMMUserNotificationCenter` uses Growl instead, if it can found. If it don't, it shows a simple `NSAlert` instead of a notification. So you still have notifications in macOS 10.6 and 10.7, but only if you have Growl. Considering that, that function has two ratings.

### - ![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) [(NSString*)string componentsMatchingWithRegex:regex] (macOS = 10.6)
This is the dirtiest hack of them all. Since `NSRegularExpression` was introduced in macOS 10.7, the only method that I found to do that (since the `RegexKit` framework do not compile anymore) is using Python. In macOS 10.6 only, that function will create a temporary file with `string` and a temporary python script which should parse `string` and return the components matching with `regex`. It's very slow in comparison to `NSRegularExpression`, and should not be used multiple times in sequence (however, it can be used simultaneously in the latest versions). At least it works using the same kind of regex that `NSRegularExpression` accepts... please, forgive me.

I tried using RegexKitLite as well (https://github.com/inquisitiveSoft/RegexKitLite), however it has some weird bugs when you use it multiple times, even after cleaning its cache.
